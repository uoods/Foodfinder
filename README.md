# FoodFinder

- This is my FoodFinder app I made for my mobile software dev class I took during 2022 Summer semester. 
- This app utilizies Google place's API to generate a restaurant near you and save the info to a list if this restaurant interests, you
or prompt the app to show you another restuarant. It's kind of like Tinder but for food, if I had more time during development
I would have made it swipe left and right.
